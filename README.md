# Supervised_LinearRegression
Our task is to predict the student score based on the nummber hours that he had spent on study.
We had used simple linear regression which is the supervised regression technique, to predict the score of the student.

Data can be found at http://bit.ly/w-data

Dataset contains 2 features--1)Study time in hours
                           --2.Scored secured by the student.
 Simple linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between two variables, where one variable is the independent variable (also known as the predictor variable) and the other is the dependent variable (also known as the response variable). Here are the key points of simple linear regression:
Simple linear regression is used to model the linear relationship between two variables.The independent variable (X) is used to predict the dependent variable (Y).
The equation of a simple linear regression model is Y = a+ bX, where a is the intercept and b is the slope of the line.The goal of simple linear regression is to estimate the values of b0 and b1 that best fit the data.
The line of best fit is the line that minimizes the sum of the squared differences between the observed values and the predicted values.The method of least squares is used to estimate the values of a and b.



###Evaluation metrics for Simple Linear regression are:

1)The correlation coefficient (r)

2)The coefficient of determination (R-squared) 

###Assumptions in Linear Regression are

---->Simple linear regression assumes that there is a linear relationship between X and Y.

----->The error term should be Normally Distributes

------>There should not be Heteroskedacity.

------->There should not be Multicollinearity.
